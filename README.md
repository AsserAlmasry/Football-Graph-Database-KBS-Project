# Modeling Football Player-Team Relationships Using Neo4j and Python

The football graph database project aims to create an extensive knowledge base for football-related entities using Neo4j, a graph database technology.

This database models football players, teams,coaches, countries, trophies, and stadiums, along with their intricate relationships, such as team 
memberships, player transfers, national team representations, coaching assignments, and match occurrences. 

This database serves as a powerful resource for analyzing and visualizing the vast network of football interactions, enabling deep insights into player 
movements, team dynamics, and competition results. 

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a graph database for football that can: 

• Store detailed information about football players, teams, coaches, countries, and stadiums. 
• Represent various relationships between these entities, such as "PLAYS_FOR," "MANAGES," "WON," and "REPRESENTS." 
• Enable querying of complex relationships such as player transfers, team rivalries, and country representations in tournaments.
